## I wish to become a web developer

My wish is to become a web developer, so I could create and learn new stuff.

I would like to become a full-stack developer but more focusing on the front-end.

So technologies that I would like to work with would be:
1. Figma
2. JavaScript Vanilla
3. git
4. React
5. sass
6. MERN-stack

and of course, many more that I would come in touch with. Because I like changes and learning.

Love and be loved.
